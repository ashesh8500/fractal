# Async Fetch Fix Test Plan

## Summary of Changes Made

I've successfully implemented the recommended fixes to resolve the async fetching issues in your egui + tokio application:

### 1. Updated Dependencies
- Updated `tokio` to version `1.39.2` with `full` features for native builds
- Added `futures = "0.3.30"` dependency

### 2. Implemented Background Tokio Runtime
- Added `rt_handle: Option<tokio::runtime::Handle>` field to `TemplateApp`
- Created a dedicated Tokio runtime in a background thread in the `new()` method
- Used `futures::future::pending()` to keep the runtime alive indefinitely

### 3. Updated Async Task Spawning
- Modified `fetch_price_history_async()` to use the runtime handle instead of `tokio::spawn`
- Added fallback to `tokio::spawn` if runtime handle is not available
- Updated `test_connection_async()` similarly

### 4. Added Debug Logging
- Added logging for fetch queue processing
- Added logging for portfolio selection changes
- Added logging for individual symbol fetches

### 5. Configuration Changes
- Set `use_native_provider: true` by default for easier testing
- Create demo portfolio automatically when no portfolios exist

## How to Test

1. **Run with logging enabled:**
   ```bash
   RUST_LOG=info cargo run
   ```

2. **Expected log output when selecting a portfolio:**
   ```
   [INFO] Queued history fetch for symbols: ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"]
   [INFO] Processing fetch queue with 3 items
   [INFO] Spawning fetch for symbol: AAPL
   [INFO] Spawning fetch for symbol: MSFT
   [INFO] Spawning fetch for symbol: GOOGL
   ```

3. **For native mode testing with Alpha Vantage:**
   ```bash
   ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here RUST_LOG=info cargo run
   ```

4. **For backend server mode:**
   - Change `use_native_provider: false` in `src/state/mod.rs`
   - Ensure your backend server is running
   - The app should now make requests to the backend API

## Key Benefits

- **Fixed async task execution**: Tasks now run in a dedicated background runtime
- **Improved error handling**: Fallback to tokio::spawn if runtime handle fails
- **Better debugging**: Comprehensive logging to track fetch operations
- **Automatic demo setup**: App creates a demo portfolio on first run for easy testing

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Demo portfolio is created automatically
- [ ] Selecting a portfolio triggers fetch queue logging
- [ ] Individual symbol fetches are logged
- [ ] Charts and data load (native mode with API key)
- [ ] Backend requests are made (backend mode)
- [ ] No "no historical data available" messages when data should be present

The async fetching issue should now be resolved. The background runtime ensures that async tasks execute properly even when the main UI thread is busy with the egui event loop.
