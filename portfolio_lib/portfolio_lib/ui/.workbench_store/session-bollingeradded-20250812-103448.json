I want to see how this performs"

Use Bollinger Bands to identify short-term price discrepancies\n2. Use Moving Averages to identify long-term trends\n3. Create a ranking system based on these two factors\n4. Rebalance the portfolio to overweight stocks with favorable combinations\n\nLet me implement this strategy:\n"

A common approach is to implement a momentum-based strategy where we buy assets that have shown positive price momentum and sell those with negative momentum.\n\nHere's my approach:\n1. Calculate the 30-day price momentum for each asset\n2. Rank assets by their momentum scores\n3. Go long on top 30% of assets (by momentum) and short on bottom 30%\n4. Rebalance monthly\n\nLet me implement this strategy and backtest it:\n"
