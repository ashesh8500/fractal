# Dev Status

## Overall Status
- **Goal**: Port the portfolio_app to the fractal repository with clean architecture
- **Current Phase**: Phase 3 - Frontend Foundation
- **Status**: Phase 2 completed successfully, ready for frontend development
- **Architecture**: Modular design with portfolio_lib + backend_server + Rust frontend

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (âœ… COMPLETED)
- [x] Create ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md with detailed system design
- [x] Set up development tracking (dev_status.md, agent.md)
- [x] Create portfolio_lib package structure
- [x] Implement core Portfolio class with dependency injection
- [x] Create DataService abstractions (base protocol)
- [x] Implement YFinance and AlphaVantage data services
- [x] Basic unit tests for core functionality (11 tests passing)
- [x] Package configuration (pyproject.toml)
- [x] Clean up placeholder implementations (replaced with pass + TODO)
- [x] Implement strategy execution engine with momentum strategy
- [x] Implement backtesting engine with comprehensive metrics
- [x] Complete all placeholder methods in Portfolio class

### Phase 2: Backend Server (âœ… COMPLETED)
- [x] Set up FastAPI server structure with clean architecture
- [x] Implement functional dependency injection using Result monads
- [x] Create core API endpoints (portfolios, strategies, market-data, backtests)
- [x] API schema definitions with Pydantic validation
- [x] Elegant error handling with Result monad pattern
- [x] Lean, composable service layer design
- [x] Integration with portfolio_lib completed

### Phase 3: Frontend Foundation (ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS)
- [x] Extend existing egui template (preserve TemplateApp structure)
- [x] Add portfolio-specific models and types
- [x] Implement API client for backend communication
- [x] Create state management system
- [x] Set up component trait system (extending egui patterns)
- [x] Type synchronization with backend schemas
- [ ] Test frontend-backend communication
- [ ] Implement async portfolio loading
- [ ] Add error handling and user feedback

### Phase 4: Core UI Components
- [ ] Port and adapt portfolio dashboard component
- [ ] Port and adapt price charts component (financial charts)
- [ ] Implement data status monitoring component
- [ ] Create component manager (extending egui app pattern)
- [ ] Basic portfolio CRUD operations in UI
- [ ] Integration with backend API

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Port risk dashboard component
- [ ] Port backtest analyzer component
- [ ] Add strategy execution capabilities
- [ ] Implement advanced charting (technical indicators)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 6: Polish & Production
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

## Phase Logs

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (âœ… COMPLETED)
- **Started**: 2025-07-30
- **Completed**: 2025-07-30
- **Final Status**: All placeholders implemented, strategy/backtesting engines complete

### Phase 2: Backend Server (âœ… COMPLETED)
- **Started**: 2025-07-30
- **Completed**: 2025-07-30
- **Architecture**: Functional programming with Result monads, clean dependency injection
- **Key Features**: FastAPI with elegant error handling, lean service layer, Pydantic validation
- **API Endpoints**: Full portfolio CRUD, strategy execution, backtesting, market data
- **Architecture Plan**: Completed comprehensive system design
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Standalone portfolio_lib for reusability in notebooks
  - Dependency injection for data services (yfinance, alphavantage)
  - Preserve and extend existing egui template structure
  - Component-based UI with Portfolio and Config parameters

## Test Summary
- **Portfolio Library**: âœ… 16/16 tests passing - All core functionality implemented
- **Backend API**: âœ… All endpoints implemented and tested  
- **Frontend Components**: Not yet implemented
- **Integration**: Not yet tested

## Current Issues (Priority Order)
1. **CRITICAL**: Historical data shows "None" on UI - portfolios from backend don't contain price_history field
2. **CRITICAL**: Candles widget has repeated widget ID causing egui errors (ComboBox needs unique IDs)
3. **HIGH**: Windows opened by candles/tables buttons cannot be closed using window close button
4. **MEDIUM**: Backend only provides current market data via /market-data endpoint, no historical price data
5. **MEDIUM**: Component window management needs proper open/close state handling
6. **MEDIUM**: Frontend expects price_history but backend portfolios don't populate this field
7. **LOW**: Charts components show placeholder text instead of actual data visualization

## Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. **CURRENT**: Fix UI component issues identified above
2. Add proper price history data to backend portfolio responses using existing market-data endpoint
3. Fix widget ID conflicts in component rendering
4. Implement proper window close functionality for component windows
5. Connect real market data to chart components
6. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback

## Testing Instructions
1. Start backend server: `python test_integration.py`
2. In another terminal: `cargo run`
3. Test frontend-backend communication via UI
4. Verify portfolio creation and data loading
