# Dev Status

## Overall Status
- **Goal**: Port the portfolio_app to the fractal repository with clean architecture
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Backend Server Setup
- **Status**: Phase 1 completed successfully, ready for backend server implementation
- **Architecture**: Modular design with portfolio_lib + backend_server + Rust frontend

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (âœ… COMPLETED)
- [x] Create ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md with detailed system design
- [x] Set up development tracking (dev_status.md, agent.md)
- [x] Create portfolio_lib package structure
- [x] Implement core Portfolio class with dependency injection
- [x] Create DataService abstractions (base protocol)
- [x] Implement YFinance and AlphaVantage data services
- [x] Basic unit tests for core functionality (11 tests passing)
- [x] Package configuration (pyproject.toml)
- [x] Clean up placeholder implementations (replaced with pass + TODO)

### Phase 2: Backend Server
- [ ] Set up FastAPI server structure
- [ ] Implement dependency injection for services
- [ ] Create core API endpoints (portfolios, strategies, market-data)
- [ ] Add persistence layer with SQLAlchemy
- [ ] API schema definitions with Pydantic
- [ ] Basic authentication and security
- [ ] API integration tests

### Phase 3: Frontend Foundation
- [ ] Extend existing egui template (preserve TemplateApp structure)
- [ ] Add portfolio-specific models and types
- [ ] Implement API client for backend communication
- [ ] Create state management system
- [ ] Set up component trait system (extending egui patterns)
- [ ] Type synchronization with backend schemas

### Phase 4: Core UI Components
- [ ] Port and adapt portfolio dashboard component
- [ ] Port and adapt price charts component (financial charts)
- [ ] Implement data status monitoring component
- [ ] Create component manager (extending egui app pattern)
- [ ] Basic portfolio CRUD operations in UI
- [ ] Integration with backend API

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- [ ] Port risk dashboard component
- [ ] Port backtest analyzer component
- [ ] Add strategy execution capabilities
- [ ] Implement advanced charting (technical indicators)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling

### Phase 6: Polish & Production
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Deployment configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup

## Phase Logs

### Phase 1: Core Foundation (In Progress)
- **Started**: 2025-07-30
- **Architecture Plan**: Completed comprehensive system design
- **Key Decisions**: 
  - Standalone portfolio_lib for reusability in notebooks
  - Dependency injection for data services (yfinance, alphavantage)
  - Preserve and extend existing egui template structure
  - Component-based UI with Portfolio and Config parameters

## Test Summary
- **Portfolio Library**: Not yet implemented
- **Backend API**: Not yet implemented  
- **Frontend Components**: Not yet implemented
- **Integration**: Not yet tested

## Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. Create portfolio_lib directory structure
2. Implement core Portfolio class with DataService dependency injection
3. Create YFinance data service implementation
4. Add basic unit tests
5. Set up pyproject.toml for library packaging
